    "1. Most colorful user\n",
    "- Initially tried this approach, but the queries required could not be completed on Apache Spark without crashing the spark session and disallowing any further queries to be run unless I restarted the IDE. To inefficient to keep chasing.\n",
    "2. User with the most distance placed between pixels on average\n",
    "- Suffered the same fate as idea 1: not enough memory to do a meaningful query. Potentially possible to batch queries that cause this much grief, but I have a feeling that would be incredibly tedious and difficult to do correctly, assuming it is possible with what I want to do for these ideas.\n",
    "3. 1 time user statistics vs 2-25 vs 26-100 \n",
    "- Again, not enough memory. Going to try to do these ideas in duckDB and then come back to spark and try my hand at batching in some queries."
