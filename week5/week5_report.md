# WEEK5 REPORT NAME TBD
Ethan Swenke

## Ideas
1. Most colorful user
- Initially tried this approach, but the queries required could not be completed on Apache Spark without crashing the spark session and disallowing any further queries to be run unless I restarted the IDE. To inefficient to keep chasing.
2. User with the most distance placed between pixels on average
3. 1 time user statistics vs 2-25 vs 26-100
