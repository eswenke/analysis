# Issues
- Shrinking the data down from 42 GB to something a little more manageable for my weakling windows machines took a little effort, seeing as I only wanted to unzip and grab part of the CSV. In this way, I created a sort of batched reader to only grab as many GB as I ask it to. This took 449840 ms for 22 GB (just for unzipping to CSV).
- There are many columns that provide an opportunity to reduce the size of the data with little to no lossiness:
    1. 
    2. 
    3. 
    4. 
    5.
